# Friday Night Funkin' (Phantoma Fork)

Phantoma <sup>_(pronounced /Fhantomah/)_</sup> is a fork of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) made to fix a couple of things
and make the vanilla game more consistent.

Phantoma is an "engine" of sorts that doesn't massively refactor FNF's code and serves as an option for people who want more settings and customizability, who also want to keep up with the latest FNF updates.

The difference between Phantoma and other forks _(like Kade and Psych Engine_) is that Phantoma focuses more on keeping up to date with new official FNF songs and features rather than focusing on the modder's ease-of-use.
